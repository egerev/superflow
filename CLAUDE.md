# Superflow — Claude Instructions

## Project Overview
Superflow is a pure Markdown skill that orchestrates a 4-phase dev workflow: onboarding, product discovery with expert panel brainstorming, Product Vision alignment, and git workflow selection, autonomous execution with a selected branch/PR strategy, and merge. v5.6.0, MIT License. Supports both **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI** as primary orchestrator (auto-detected at startup via `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`).

## Key Rules
- All documentation output in English — user communication follows their language preference
- Dispatch subagents for all code/analysis — orchestrator reads, plans, reviews, dispatches
- Use `subagent_type: deep-doc-writer` for documentation agents — effort controlled via agent definition frontmatter, not prompt keywords
- Verify framework names by reading actual `import` statements, never guess from directory names
- Every claim in generated docs needs evidence (file path, count, command output)

## Architecture

**Key v4.0 artifacts:**
- **Autonomy Charter** (`docs/superflow/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-charter.md`): generated at end of Phase 1, injected into every sprint prompt and reviewer. Contains goal, non-negotiables, success criteria, governance mode, git workflow mode, and model profile.
- **completion-data.json** (`.superflow/completion-data.json`): structured completion data for Phase 3 merge context.
- **Heartbeat block** (optional field in `.superflow-state.json`): compaction-recovery snapshot written at sprint start and each stage transition. 9 fields: `updated_at`, `current_sprint`, `sprint_goal`, `merge_method`, `active_worktree`, `active_branch`, `must_reread`, `last_review_verdict`, `phase2_step`. Enforced by Rule 12; PreCompact hook surfaces it in the dump.
- **Event log** (`.superflow/events.jsonl`): append-only JSONL telemetry stream. Each line is a compact JSON object conforming to `templates/event-schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12, 549 lines, 21 event types incl. `pr.fail`). Emitted via `tools/sf-emit.sh`. `SUPERFLOW_RUN_ID` (lowercase UUID — uuidgen output is piped through `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`) groups all events for a run; persisted to `.superflow-state.json` under `context.run_id` for recovery after `/clear`.

## Conventions
- Pure Markdown skill (no Python, no pip dependencies)
- File references use relative paths from project root
- Phase docs are re-read at every phase/sprint boundary (compaction erases skill content)
- Markers: `<!-- updated-by-superflow:YYYY-MM-DD -->` appended to generated files
- Both `<!-- updated-by-superflow:` and `<!-- superflow:onboarded` are valid markers (backwards compat)
- Breakage scenario required for every review finding — no scenario = not a finding
- All phases use stage/todo structure with TaskCreate for progress tracking
- `.superflow-state.json` persists phase/stage for crash recovery (gitignored); extended with `brief_file`, `charter_file`, `completion_data_file`, `governance_mode`, `git_workflow_mode`, `use_workflows`, and optional `heartbeat` block for compaction drift defense
- **Governance modes** (light/standard/critical): auto-suggested at Phase 1 start, stored in state and charter. Controls review depth, holistic review threshold, and plan complexity
- **Git workflow modes** (`solo_single_pr`, `sprint_pr_queue`, `stacked_prs`, `parallel_wave_prs`, `trunk_based`): selected in Phase 1, stored in state and charter, and controls branch base, PR count, sprint parallelism, and merge order
- **Model policy (fixed)**: Fable access is blocked, so there is no model-profile selection. Deep judgment roles (spec/code/product reviewers + deep-analyst) run on Opus at max effort; standard reviewers/doc-writers on Opus at high effort; implementers on Sonnet. Depth is differentiated by effort, not model
- **Product Vision alignment**: Phase 1 uses a single recommendation-led decision brief with options, tradeoffs, reversibility, safe defaults, and support for "do what you recommend", one-message, or audio-transcript answers. It replaces the old design-tree grilling pattern.
- **Autonomy Charter**: durable intent artifact generated at end of Phase 1. Injected into sprint prompts and reviewers as single source of truth for autonomous execution boundaries
- **Event emission**: `source tools/sf-emit.sh && sf_emit <type> key=val key:int=N key:bool=true key:json='{"x":1}'`. Typed key syntax: bare `=` → string, `:int=` → number, `:bool=` → boolean, `:json=` → raw JSON. jq-only construction; validates type against allowlist and key names against identifier regex before emitting one compact JSONL line. `pr.fail` (added in 5.4.0) is emitted when a PR CI run concludes red or a PR is abandoned: `pr_number` (int, required), `reason` (string, required), `ci_run_id` (string, optional).
- **Model tier policy**: deep-spec/code/product-reviewer + deep-analyst = `opus`/max; deep-doc-writer = `opus`/max; deep-implementer = `sonnet`/max; standard reviewers + standard-doc-writer = `opus`/high; standard-implementer = `sonnet`/high; fast-implementer = `sonnet`/low. Always pass `model:` explicitly in Agent() calls (deep reviewers + deep-analyst → `"opus"`). Fable access is blocked — every judgment role runs on Opus, depth differentiated by effort. A forgotten `model:` silently inherits the orchestrator's session model (Opus), wrong for implementers (more expensive than the intended Sonnet).
- **Reviewer verdict contract**: every reviewer ends its final message with a fenced `json` block — `{"verdict": ..., "findings": [{severity, file, line, scenario, description}], "summary": ...}`. The orchestrator extracts the fence (awk → jq) and assembles `.par-evidence.json` mechanically — no prose parsing. Re-review goes to the SAME named background reviewer via SendMessage (cold re-dispatch as fallback).
- **Workflow acceleration (hybrid, opt-in)**: Phase 2 may use saved multi-agent workflows for exactly two spots — `/superflow-review` (unified review fan-out) and `/superflow-wave` (parallel implementation wave). Gated on Claude runtime + `context.use_workflows=true` (recorded at Phase 1 Step 12 plan approval; "no-workflows" opts out; always false on Codex) + availability (CLI ≥ 2.1.154, not `disableWorkflows`/`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_WORKFLOWS=1`); every other case falls back to the Agent-based v5.4.0 paths with no behavior change. Shipped scripts use ONLY the documented API surface (`agent`, `parallel`, `phase`, `log`, `args`) — never undocumented fields (`schema`, `agentType`, `isolation`, `resume-run-id`); structured data returns via the fenced-JSON verdict contract with fail-closed parsing; PAR evidence from this path records `provider: "workflow-review"`. At Phase 2 launch the orchestrator prints a ready-to-paste `/goal` watchdog suggestion (user-only command — the model cannot set it). Single authority: `references/workflow-orchestration.md`
- **Deploy checksum sync**: SKILL.md startup (step 4) syncs deployed copies via `cmp -s` + overwrite-on-mismatch — `superflow-enforcement.md` → `~/.claude/rules/`, `agents/*.md` → `~/.claude/agents/`, and `workflows/*.js` → `~/.claude/workflows/` (Claude runtime); `codex/agents/*.toml` → `~/.codex/agents/` and `codex/AGENTS.md` → `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (Codex runtime). Exception: `~/.codex/hooks.json` is installed only if missing, never overwritten (one-line warning asks to merge manually).
- **Testcontainers canon**: the only env var is `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED`, set exclusively when `process.env.CI === "true"` — the duty lives in `agents/*-implementer.md` definitions. Orchestrator cleanup runs ONLY `bash $SUPERFLOW_SKILL_ROOT/tools/cleanup-testcontainers.sh` (label-based `label=org.testcontainers=true`); name-regex matching and raw `docker` commands are forbidden.
- **Heartbeat cadence**: Claude runtime checks heartbeat/`must_reread` at sprint boundaries, stage transitions, and immediately after compaction/summarization; Codex runtime keeps every-turn discipline (no PreCompact hook, 258K context).
- **Codex model policy**: Codex subagents and Claude-runtime `codex exec` secondary calls use `gpt-5.5`; deep analyst/implementer/reviewer roles use `xhigh`, standard roles use `high`, and fast implementer uses `medium`. Codex-runtime Claude product/research secondary calls use `--effort xhigh` on `claude-opus-4-8` (Fable access is blocked).
- **Per-PR docs gate**: every PR must run documentation update and separate documentation review before `gh pr create`. In per-sprint PR modes this happens every sprint; in `solo_single_pr` it happens before the final PR. `.par-evidence.json` must include `docs_update` (`UPDATED` or `UNCHANGED`) and `docs_review: PASS`; `llms.txt` is explicitly audited for every PR.

## Known Issues & Tech Debt
- Greenfield templates (nextjs.md, python.md) provide config files but not source file contents — LLM generates those
- **Phase 3 post-compaction merge regression**: context compaction during Phase 3 merge loop can cause agent to fall back to local `git merge` instead of `gh pr merge --rebase --delete-branch`. Mitigated by: (1) merge method rule in `superflow-enforcement.md` (survives compaction); (2) heartbeat `must_reread` includes `references/phase3-merge.md`; (3) since 5.4.0 — Claude runtime waits for PR checks via the native Monitor tool (no manual polling drift) and post-merge verification reads `baseline_test_cmd` from `.superflow/completion-data.json` via jq with Autonomy Charter fallback (the fragile `sprint-queue.json` python one-liner is gone). Residual risk: re-read `phase3-merge.md` before each PR merge after compaction.
- **Codex sprint-level parallelism**: recommended config is `[agents] max_threads=6, max_depth=2`. This allows sprint supervisors to spawn per-sprint implement/review/doc agents, enabling sprint-level parallel waves in Codex when `git_workflow_mode` permits. Old `max_depth=1` configs fall back to sequential sprints.
- **Codex no PreCompact/PostCompact**: compaction recovery relies on Stop hook dumps + SessionStart re-injection + self-referential rule in AGENTS.md. Less reliable than Claude's hook-based recovery.
- **Codex context ~258K**: 4x smaller than Claude's 1M. Long Phase 2 runs (4+ sprints) require session-per-wave/session-per-sprint strategy or aggressive /compact usage.
- **Per-event-type key allowlist**: `sf_emit` validates key names against an identifier regex and the event type against a global allowlist (21 types), but does not yet validate which keys are legal per event type. Practical injection is blocked; semantic key validation deferred to a future sprint.
